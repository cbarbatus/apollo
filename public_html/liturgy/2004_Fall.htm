<B><P>AUTUMN EQUINOX RITUAL</B> <BR>
Raven's Cry Grove, ADF </P>
<P>September 12, 2004</P>
<P>composed by Todd Covert, Senior Druid </P>
<P>At Pagan Pride Day L.A. event (opening ritual)</P>
<P>OFFICIANTS: <BR>
Presiding Druid (PD) <BR>
Sacrificer (SAC) <BR>
Bard (BARD) <BR>
Other Druids (D1, D2, D3, etc.)</P>
<P>At the center of the ritual site, PD is seated at a drum. Adjacent is a harp, a cauldron, and a fire vessel. SAC stands nearby.&nbsp; </P>
<B><P>Call to the Rite</B> </P>
<P>PD begins a loud drumbeat to announce the rite.</P>
<P><B>Invocation of the Awen</B> </P>
<P>BARD advances to the harp and begins to play, then speaks the following:</P>
<P>"A Bhrid!&nbsp; Lady Brigit! <BR>
We call on you to guide our rite in the way of truth." </P>
<P>BARD then sings a hymn to Brigit seeking her assistance with the rite.</P>
<B><P>Establishment of the Hallows</B> </P>
<P>At three positions around the event site are situated: D1, carrying a large vessel of consecrated water; D2, carrying a torch; and D3 and D4, carrying a tree in a large pot.  They may be accompanied by drummers. As the BARD begins to invoke Brigit, D1, D2, and D3/D4 (w/any respective accompanists) begin to speak simultaneously and to advance in a tightening sunwise spiral towards the center of the ritual space. As they do so, others exhort the people at the event to come to the rite. PD continues to drum at the center throughout.</P>
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH=589>
<TR><TD WIDTH="34%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The Well: </P>
<P>D1:&nbsp; "Sacred Source, Cauldron of making and unmaking, <BR>
Fathomless Sea, bountiful Spring, <BR>
Mother of the Rivers, you who were known of old as Danu. <BR>
May we be nourished in body and mind by you. </P>
<P>Uisci naomh, sruthaigh ionainn. <BR>
Sacred Waters, flow within us."</P>
<P>(When the Center is reached, the water will be poured into the cauldron.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD WIDTH="31%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The Fire: </P>
<P>D2:&nbsp; "Sacred Fire, sacrificed and sacrificer, <BR>
You who rise to meet your Kin <BR>
The Shining Ones, <BR>
Holy flame of hearth and altar, known of old as Belenos. <BR>
May we be strengthened in spirit and honor by you.</P>
<P>Tine naomh, loisc ionainn. <BR>
Sacred Fire, burn within us."</P>
<P>(When the Center is reached, the fire vessel will be ignited.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD WIDTH="35%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The Bile (Sacred Tree): </P>
<P>D3:&nbsp; "Sacred Tree, rooted deep and crowned high, <BR>
Center of the Earth and axis of the Worlds, <BR>
Most honorable of the Kindred of this place. <BR>
May your roots drink deep of the Waters below. </P>
<P>May you draw life from the Fire of the Heavens </P>
<P>You hold the very mystery of Life, <BR>
Piercing the Sky, yielding to the Waters.<BR>
May we grow in love and courage <BR>
Each time we gather around you.</P>
<P>Crann naomh, fas ionainn. <BR>
Sacred Tree, grow within us."</P>
<P>(When the Center is reached, the tree will be placed in the midst of the Hallows.) </P>
<P>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>At the moment the three prayers above have been completed (and as the procession of the water, fire and tree continues to center), PD steps forward and begins the Call for Peace:</P>
<P>PD speaks first to the East: <BR>
"May there be peace in the East, ancient Leinster, source of Prosperity." <BR>
To the South: "May there be peace in the South, ancient Munster, source of Harmony." <BR>
To the West: "May there be peace in the West, ancient Connacht, source of Wisdom." <BR>
To the North: "May there be peace in the North, ancient Ulster, source of Strength. <BR>
Returns to Center: "Here in the Center, let peace rule over this rite." <BR>
May it be so! Biodh se amlaidh!"</P>
<P>As this is finished, the water should have been poured in the Well and the Fire lit. When the Tree has been placed, all drumming/playing ceases and there is a moment of quiet.</P>
<B><P>Protecting the Hallows </P>
</B> 
<P>PD speaks: </P>
<P>&quot;From ancient times down through recent years, it has been the custom in
Ireland and Scotland to protect the lives and the property of the people from
untoward beings by processing with torch about a boundary.&nbsp; In the custom
of this Grove, we light a flame to mark a boundary between order and chaos. </P>
<P>&quot;In doing so, we invite the beings opposed to order to take what warmth
they will from the flame.&nbsp; We recognize that--while they do not have a
place within the order of ritual--they are still real beings and not merely
'forces of evil'.&nbsp; In our tradition we respect the 'Other', we do not
reduce him or her to mere caricature. </P>
<P>&quot;But it is meet at this time to ward this sacred space, so--after the
custom of our Ancestors--we ask you all to face outward, away from the Center,
and pass the torch from one to another.&nbsp; As you do so, have in your
mind--or even speak--something you would not have present in this rite. </P>
<P>&quot;As you take the torch in hand, know that you are yourself protected and
sanctified for the working of this rite.&quot; </P>
<P>The torch is brought forward and passed to someone in the South and passed
about from person to person, sunwise. </P>
<P>SAC speaks (while PD continues the drum beat) and begins to strew rosemary around the perimeter of the ritual space: </P>
<P>"Ancient and Dark Ones of the deep and the wild, <BR>
You who held this place of old and would hold it once again,</P>
<P>Accept this offering and trouble not our rite.</P>
<P>The children of the Shining Ones would gather in this place</P>
<P>And bid you remain beyond the circle of our torchlight for this time,<BR>But
take what share of warmth you will.&nbsp; </P>
<P>
Biodh se amhlaidh.&quot; </P>
<B><P>Sanctifying the Participants</B> </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; &quot;As you have been purified by Fire, so be cleansed by the
Waters.&quot;</P>
<P>One of the Druids asperses the participants as drumming begins.</P>
<B><P>Opening the Gates to the Otherworlds</B> </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "We now call on Manannan Mac Lir, <BR>
Lord of the Otherworlds,&nbsp; Keeper of the Ways between the Worlds, <BR>
To make open the portals for our worship."</P>
<P>PD moves among the Hallows as the drumbeat grows in intensity.</P>
<P>PD: "A Mhanannain Mac Lir, Gatekeeper, Sidhe King, <BR>
Let our words sound in the depths of the Well."</P>
<P>A drop of oil is poured on the waters of the Well. </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "Let our words rise on the Fire to the Shining Ones."</P>
<P>Oil is poured on the Fire.</P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "Let the Sacred Tree carry our words to all the Worlds. </P>
<P>&quot;Lord of Ways and Waves, guide and ward us in all the Worlds.&quot; </P>
<P>The Tree is anointed with oil.</P>
<P>PD: "A Mhanannain Mac Lir, osclaitear na Geatai anois. <BR>
Let the Gates be open!"</P>
<P>PD raises his/her arms at this and there is a final catharsis of drumming at the opening of the Gates.</P>
<P>After a brief re-settling, PD continues:</P>
<B><P>The Three Kindreds</B> </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "Let us now give honor to the Three Kindreds, <BR>
That they may honor us in return." </P>
<B><P>Honoring the Ancestors</B> </P>
<P>D1:&nbsp; "A Shinseara!&nbsp; Ancestors!&nbsp; You who guide our steps, <BR>
You who carry the honor of the People to the Otherworlds, <BR>
We honor you with the first portion and offer this cup for your taking. <BR>
Ancestors, guide us in our rite." </P>
<P>Ale is poured in the Well and the remainder set in a cup on the altar. </P>
<P>D1:&nbsp; " Biodh se amhlaidh." </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "Biodh se amhlaidh." </P>
<B><P>Inviting the Spirits of the Land</P>
</B><P>D2:&nbsp; "A Sprideanna na talaimh!&nbsp; Spirits of the Land!</P>
<P>Fair folk, green kin, and totem beasts! Kindred of this Land! <BR>
We thank you for sharing this place with us and offer these gifts in return. <BR>
Earth Spirits, join us in our rite." </P>
<P>Flowers or fruit or the like is placed amongst the Hallows. </P>
<P>D2:&nbsp; "Biodh se amhlaidh." </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "Biodh se amhlaidh." </P>
<B><P>Offering to the Deities</B> </P>
<P>D3:&nbsp; "A Dheithe!&nbsp; Shining Ones!&nbsp; Highest and mightiest, worthiest of honor!</P>
<P>Ancient of the Tuatha De Danann, we would offer to you in this place. <BR>
Deities of this place, known to us or unknown, <BR>
Gods and Goddesses of all those here, Patrons and Matrons, <BR>
We would offer you like honor. <BR>
Join us at our fire, o Shining Ones. <BR>
A Dheithe, glacigi ar n-iobairt seo! <BR>
Shining Ones, accept our sacrifice!" </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "Shining Ones, accept our sacrifice!" </P>
<P>Oil is poured on the Fire </P>
<B><P>Main Offering</B> </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "We call once more on Manannan mac Lir, keeper of the Silver Branch
that opens the way to the Land of Promise, ruler of the Gods in the Otherworld.&quot;</P>
<P>Incense (Irish peat) is offered to the Fire.</P>
<P>&quot;A Mhanannain!&nbsp; Stand beside us here and aid us in our work!&nbsp;
The children of the Earth call to you!&nbsp; Cross the waves and join us at the
Fire!</P>
<P>&quot;A Mhanannain!&nbsp; Accept our offering!&quot;</P>
<P>All:&nbsp; &quot;Accept our offering!&quot;</P>
<P>PD: &quot;Biodh se amhlaidh!</P>
<P>&quot;It is all too true of human beings that they cast their shadow on
another.&nbsp; We seek an adversary all too often in life and feel we must
reduce his honor that we can worthily destroy him.</P>
<P>&quot;But the enemy is often a being merely different in intentions, not
simply 'evil'.</P>
<P>&quot;So it was for the ancient Irish:&nbsp; When the gods were chafing under
the rule of a king who came from among their adversaries, the Fomorians, and
deposed him, when that king--one Bres--returned to the Fomorians, they chastised
him for abusing the society of the Gods.&nbsp; Even among the opponents of the
Gods, honor and empathy could be found.</P>
<P>&quot;And when war arose from this, the champion of the Gods was Lugh...who
was born of a union between one of the Gods, Cian, and one of the Fomorians,
Eithne.&nbsp; These races were bitter rivals and made most horrific war on each
other, but they understood each other as possessed of honor and knowledge.&nbsp;
When the war was concluded with the Gods triumphant, the terms for peace was
nothing less than the sharing of the secret for unlocking the bounty of the
Land&quot;</P>
<P>Candles are passed out to the participants.</P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; &quot;Earlier we passed a flame about this space and asked that the
Outsiders remain apart...and so that must be with the opponents of our
worship...they must keep their distance.&nbsp; But this does not mean we cannot
learn from them.&nbsp; We may learn--at the least--about our own shadow...how we
are ourselves opponents to our own growth and prosperity in spite of ourselves.</P>
<P>&quot;And so I call on Manannan to ride the boundary on his swift horse now
and protect us from harm.&nbsp; And as the torch is brought around, this time
facing in, light your candle from it and think--or speak--what lesson might be
learned from someone you consider opponent or Other...of yourself or of this
community or even the mighty Kindreds...and invite that lesson into this place,
even if it may mean releasing hostility or pride.&quot;</P>
<P>The torch is passed so that the candles may be lit.&nbsp; When all are lit, a
wooden bowl is brought forth.</P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; &quot;As this bowl is brought before you, allow some of the wax of
your candle to fall into it.&nbsp; Let that be the worthiest lesson you can
bring from your opponent that it may be offered to the Shining Ones as surety of
peace.&quot;</P>
<P>After all the wax has been collected, the bowl is brought to the PD.</P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; &quot;Sidhe King!&nbsp; The people have done a courageous thing
with your aid!&nbsp; They have faced an adversary and proclaimed it
worthy!&nbsp; Now carry the lessons in this vessel to your kin!</P>
<P>&quot;Shining Ones, accept our offering&quot;!</P>
<P>All:&nbsp; &quot;Shining Ones, accept our offering!&quot;</P>
<P>The bowl containing the wax is placed in the Fire.&nbsp; As the offering
burns, a chant may be sung.</P>
<P><B>Taking of the Omen</B> </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "Having made offering to the Gods, let us see how our offering was received."</P>
<P>SAC consults ogham (or runes) and announces the results of the omen-taking.&nbsp; If the omen is inauspicious, further offerings may be made and a second omen taken.&nbsp; If the omen is again unfavorable, the rite should be ended, with due thanks made to the Kindreds.&nbsp; If the omen is auspicious, the rite proceeds.</P>
<B><P>Seeking the Blessings of the Deities</B> </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "In our custom, a gift calls for a gift. <BR>
Having offered to the Powers, <BR>
We seek their blessings in return." </P>
<P>PD pours ale (or the like) into a cup and holds it up. </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "Shining Ones, we seek the blessings of the three Cauldrons, <BR>
Of Wisdom, of Plenty, and of Rebirth. <BR>
We would share in your magic. <BR>
And so we say as one folk:&nbsp; Shining Ones, give us the Waters!" </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "Shining Ones, give us the Waters!" </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "We would stand in fellowship with you <BR>
And feast at your side and proclaim ourselves your People. <BR>
And so we say again:&nbsp; Shining Ones, give us the Waters!" </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "Shining Ones, give us the Waters!" </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; We have offered of our love and our work to you; <BR>
We have shared our hearthside, <BR>
And, as a gift calls for a gift, <BR>
We say one last time:&nbsp; Shining Ones, give us the Waters of Life!" </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "Shining Ones, give us the Waters of Life! </P>
<P>PD elevates the cup saying: <BR>
&quot;Seo iad na h-Uisci Beatha! <BR>
These are the Waters of Life!" </P>
<P>PD holds the cup before the participants:</P>
<P>PD: "As one community, we share this draft with the land upon which we stand that all who join us here today are nourished not only in body but in spirit.  Biodh se amhlaidh!"</P>
<P>PD pours the cup onto the earth.</P>
<B><P>Thanking the Kindreds</B> </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "Let us now give thanks to the Powers we have honored here." </P>
<P>D3:&nbsp; "A Dheithe!&nbsp; Deities!&nbsp; Go raibh maith agaibh.&nbsp; We thank you." </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "We thank you." </P>
<P>D2:&nbsp; "A sprideanna na talaimh!&nbsp; Earth Spirits!&nbsp; Go raibh maith agaibh.&nbsp; We thank you." </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "We thank you." </P>
<P>D1:&nbsp; "A Shinseara!&nbsp; Ancestors!&nbsp; Go raibh maith agaibh.&nbsp; We thank you." </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "We thank you."</P>
<P>BARD:&nbsp; "A Bhrid!&nbsp; Lady Brigit!&nbsp; Go raibh maith agat.&nbsp; We thank you." </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "We thank you." </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "To all those Powers that have aided our rite, <BR>
We say once more:&nbsp; go raibh maith agaibh.&nbsp; We thank you." </P>
<P>All:&nbsp; "We thank you."</P>
<B><P>Closing the Gates</B> </P>
<P>PD:&nbsp; "A Mhanannain!&nbsp; Gatekeeper and Sidhe King! <BR>
We thank you for guiding our prayers to the Otherworlds. <BR>
A Mhanannain Mac Lir, dun na Geatai anois! <BR>
Let the Gates now be closed!</P>
<P>"Brothers and sisters, the rite is ended…let this day’s celebration begin!" </P>
